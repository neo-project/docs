### How to use C# to write an AntShares smart contract

We currently recommend C# for developing smart contracts (though we support or plan to support Java, Kotlin, Go, C/C + +, Python, JavaScript and other programming languages)

This section contains a short tutorial that guides you in configuring the C# development environment for AntShares smart contracts and gives you an idea of ​​how to create a smart contract project and how to compile it.

   > [!Note] 
   > At present, all the projects have been upgraded to the Visual Studio 2017 version, if you want to use Visual Studio 2015 to create intelligent contracts can refer to [how to use C # to write ants intelligent contract for VS2015](getting-started-2015.md)

## Development Tools

### 1. Visual Studio 2017

If you have already installed Visual Studio 2017 on your computer and checked for .NET .NET Cross-Platform Development at the time of installation, you can skip this section.

Download and install:

[Visual Studio download address](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs)

The installation process is very simple, follow the prompts step by step operation can be, it should be noted that the need to check the installation of `.NET Core cross-platform development`, the installation takes about ten minutes or tens of minutes.

### 2.AntShares.SmartContract plugin

installation method:

Open Visual Studio 2017, open the tool, expand and update, click on the left side of the search, search AntShares, install the AntShares.SmartContract plugin (the process needs to be networked)

### 3. AntShares.Compiler.MSIL

Installation and configuration methods:

Download the [AntShares.VM](https://github.com/AntShares/AntShares.VM) project on Github, open the solution with Visual Studio 2017, publish the AntShares.Compiler.MSIL project,

After the release is successful, the AntShares.Compiler.MSIL.exe file is generated in `bin\Release\PublishOutput`

We now need to add this directory to our execution path:

Press the Windows + S key, enter the "environment variable", select "edit the account environment variable" carriage return

## Create project

After the above installation configuration is successful, you can create an AntShares smart contract project in Visual Studio 2017.

Once you create a project, it will automatically generate a C# file, the default class inherited from the FunctionCode, as shown in the following:

## Compile the Project

Everything is now ready to add the entry method that defines the smart contract:

```c#
public class Contract1: FunctionCode
{
    public static void Main ()// Note that the main method to capitalize
    {
        
    }
}
```

After you compile successfully, you will see` SmartContract1.avm` in the `bin/Debug` directory, which is the file that is generated by the AntShares smart contract.

Now that you have completed the configuration of the AntShares smart contract development environment, please refer to the [Art Experiment Guide for Tomids](tutorial.md)
