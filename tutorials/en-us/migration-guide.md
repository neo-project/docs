8. Input the amount you want to migrate. 

   > [!Note]
   >
   > Remark: A 1 GAS fee is required if you are migrating less than 10 NEO or 20 GAS. This is because fees are now required on all Neo N3 transactions. Allowing users to migrate small quantities of tokens with no fee opens up an exploit where users could potentially spam transactions to burn Neo Foundation GAS inefficiently.
