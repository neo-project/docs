# Before You Begin

In next sections, we will work you through an example of how to release an NEP17 asset on Neo blockchain, which includes the tasks of setting up and configuring the development environment, compiling, deploying and invoking the smart contract on a private Neo chain.

## System environment

You are recommended to run Neo-CLI in the following environments that we have tested:

- Windows 10
- Ubuntu 16.04/18.04
- CentOS 7.4/7.6
- macOS Big Sur/version 11.1

### Download Neo-CLI

Neo provides two full-node clients: NEO-GUI and NEO-CLI. This tutorial is based on the usage of Neo-CLI.

Refer to [Neo-CLI Setup](../node/cli/setup.md) to download and install Neo-CLI package from GitHub.
