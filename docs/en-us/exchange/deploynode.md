# Deploying Neo Nodes on Server

## Install Neo client

1. Install [.NET Core Runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core#/runtime) on the server, 5.0 and the later version.
2. From GitHub, download the [Neo-CLI](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-node/releases) program and enable the Neo node.

## Install plugins

Some additional functionalities are individually encapsulated in plug-ins for the purpose of improving node security, stability, and flexibility. For more information, refer to [Installing plugins](../node/cli/config.html#installing-plugins).

Go to [here](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-modules/releases/) to download plugins. Exchanges need to install the following plugins to get the complete functionality of transaction log API and automatic synchronization with the offline package:

- ApplicationLogs (Mandatory)
- LevelDBStore (Preloaded)
- RpcServer (Mandatory)
- TokensTracker (Recommended)

Unzip the plugin packages under the Neo-CLI root directory, as shown below, all the plugin files are extracted into the Plugins folder automatically.

You can also install plugins using CLI commandsï¼š

```
install ApplicationLogs
install LevelDBStore
install RpcServer
install TokensTracker
```

> [!Note]
>
> - The RpcServer plug-in must be installed before you can use the TokensTracker plug-in.
> - You must install the plugins ApplicationLogs and TokensTracker before synchronizing the Neo client, otherwise the log in the blocks synchronized before will be lost.

## Modifying configuration files

Before running Neo-CLI, you need to make necessary configurations in the Neo-CLI configuration files. For more information, refer to [Configuring and Starting Neo-CLI](../node/cli/config.md).
