# Smart Contract Framework

The smart contract framework provides consistent APIs across several programming languages that programmers can use to manipulate state on the blockchain.

The smart contract framework currently supports [.NET Framework](fw/dotnet.md). In the future, we will also support other mainstream programming languages like Java, Python, C/C++, and Go.
