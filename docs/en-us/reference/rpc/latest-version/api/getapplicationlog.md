Response description:

- txid: Transaction ID.

- trigger: Triggers.

- vmstate: VM execution state. HALT represents success, and FAULT represents failure.
- gasconsumed: The transaction fee, which means the GAS consumed in the transaction execution. 
- notifications: The notification sent by the smart contract. If no notifications is returned it indicates the transfer is not successful. See the Note below.

- contract: The contract sending the notification. Here is GasToken.

- eventname: Event name of the notification.

- state: Notification content, where ByteString is Base64-encoded wallet address and can be converted at https://neo.org/converter/index.

> [!Note]
>
> This example shows the log of a successful token transfer, however, in case of a failed transfer or NeoVM exception, the outcomes can be:
>
> - Failed transfer: no Transfer notification event is returned, execution ends in a `HALT` state with a stack value of `False`.
> - NeoVM exception: a Transfer notification event may or may not be returned, but execution ends in a `FAULT` state.
